Misc Python scripts and modules I have made

Each module will be in a separate folder inside of the "modules" subdirectory.  There may also be supporting files or files useful for testing in these subdirectories.

Don't use modules in the "in progress" folder, as they are either unfinished or buggy at the moment.
