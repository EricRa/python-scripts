## Misc Python scripts and modules I have made

Each module will be in a separate folder inside of the "modules" subdirectory.  There may also be supporting files or files useful for testing in these subdirectories.

Don't use modules in the "in progress" folder, as they are either unfinished or buggy at the moment.

Some of these were for testing and learning purposes and are not practical/sensible to use.
